Once you have set up your templates and reviewed the sample outputs, you can start generating creatives. There are two options for generating a feed: you can either generate it once or schedule feed generation at specific intervals. Scheduling feed generation allows for easy creation and management of a continuous flow of creatives. Additionally, you have the option to customize the output file before generating the feed and set up notifications.

### Schedule Runs

The Creative Feed Generator provides scheduling options for generating output creatives. Users can choose between one-time runs or recurring runs based on their preferences. This flexibility enables seamless integration with ads managers and offers control over content delivery.

- Choose between a one-time run or recurring runs.
- Set the frequency and time for the scheduled runs.

### Output File Config

The output file configuration allows you to customize the output file generated by the Creative Feed Generator.

- **File Location**: To specify the location where the output file will be saved, you can provide an output file link. If you don't provide a link, a default link will be generated for you to view the output file.
- **Choosing Columns**: Select the specific columns you want to include in the output file.
- **Edit Column Names**: Provide friendly names to columns.

### Set Up Email Notification

To stay updated on project activities, you have the option to set up email notifications. These notifications will be triggered whenever there are updates made to the project, such as feed generation or project deletion.
